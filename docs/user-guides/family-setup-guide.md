Solutions:
- Use nutritional yeast instead of cheese
- Focus on naturally vegetarian proteins everyone likes
- Always check packaged foods for both dairy and nuts

- Find dairy-free, nut-free treats everyone enjoys
```

## Troubleshooting Family Setup

### Common Setup Challenges

#### "AI suggestions don't fit our family"
**Solutions**:
1. **Review profile completeness** - missing information affects suggestions
2. **Check restriction settings** - overly broad restrictions limit options
3. **Rate more recipes** - AI needs feedback to learn preferences
4. **Adjust constraints** - time/budget/skill level may be too limiting
5. **Start with familiar foods** then gradually expand comfort zone

#### "Family members have conflicting preferences"
**Solutions**:
1. **Focus on common ground** foods everyone tolerates
2. **Use modification strategies** - base recipe with adaptations
3. **Plan individual preferences** - different proteins for same meal
4. **Gradual introduction** - slowly expand everyone's comfort zone
5. **Compromise rotation** - some meals favor different family members

#### "Kids won't eat suggested meals"
**Solutions**:
1. **Check age-appropriate settings** - ensure child-friendly focus
2. **Review spice tolerance** - may be set too high for children
3. **Involve kids in selection** - let them choose from appropriate options
4. **Start with familiar flavors** - gradually introduce new elements
5. **Consider presentation** - same foods in more appealing formats

### Profile Maintenance

#### Regular Updates
- **Monthly profile review**: Update as preferences change
- **Seasonal adjustments**: Modify for weather/holiday preferences
- **Growth updates**: Children's changing needs and preferences
