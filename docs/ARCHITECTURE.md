# MealMenu Architecture

## System Overview

MealMenu is designed as a modern, cloud-native family meal preparation application built with microservices architecture principles.

## Architecture Components

### Core Services
- **Authentication Service**: JWT-based user authentication and authorization
- **Recipe Service**: Recipe management, storage, and retrieval
- **Family Service**: Family member management and preferences
- **Menu Planning Service**: AI-powered meal planning and suggestions
- **Shopping List Service**: Automated grocery list generation
- **Nutrition Service**: Nutritional analysis and tracking
- **AI Integration Service**: Integration with Google Gemini AI for intelligent meal suggestions and recipe recommendations

### External Integrations
- **Google Gemini AI**: Intelligent meal suggestions and recipe recommendations
- **Nutrition API**: Food nutritional data lookup
- **Recipe APIs**: External recipe database integration

### Data Layer
- **Primary Database**: SQL Server for transactional data
- **Cache Layer**: Redis for session management and frequent queries
- **File Storage**: Azure Blob Storage for recipe images and documents

### Frontend
- **Web Application**: React with TypeScript
- **Mobile Support**: Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit for application state

## Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: ASP.NET Core 8.0 Web API
- **ORM**: Entity Framework Core
- **Authentication**: JWT Bearer tokens
- **Validation**: FluentValidation
- **Logging**: Serilog with structured logging
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom components
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **HTTP Client**: Axios with interceptors
- **Testing**: Jest and React Testing Library

### Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes (production)
- **Cloud Platform**: Microsoft Azure (primary), AWS (alternative)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Monitoring**: Application Insights, Prometheus, Grafana

## Security Architecture

### Authentication Flow
1. User login with email/password
2. JWT token generation with refresh token
3. Token-based API authentication
4. Automatic token refresh handling

### Data Protection
- Encryption at rest for sensitive data
- HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Input validation and sanitization
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries

### API Security
- Rate limiting per user/IP
- CORS configuration for frontend domains
- Request/response validation
- Audit logging for sensitive operations

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment
- Local Docker Compose setup
- In-memory database for rapid development
- Mock AI service for offline development
- Hot reload for both frontend and backend

### Production Environment
- Kubernetes cluster deployment
- Azure SQL Database with failover
- Redis cluster for caching
- CDN for static assets
- Load balancer with SSL termination

## Data Flow

### Meal Planning Process
1. User selects family members and preferences
2. System queries AI service for suggestions
3. AI service processes family persona data
4. Suggestions filtered and ranked
5. User customizes and saves meal plan
6. Shopping list generated automatically

### Recipe Management
1. User uploads recipe data and images
2. System extracts nutritional information
3. Recipe stored with metadata
4. Full-text search indexing
5. Image processing and thumbnail generation

## Performance Considerations

### Caching Strategy
- API response caching with Redis
- Frontend component memoization
- Database query result caching
- CDN for static assets

### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling with Kubernetes
- Database read replicas
- Microservices independent scaling
- Event-driven architecture for loose coupling

## Monitoring and Observability

### Application Monitoring
- Real-time performance metrics
- Error tracking and alerting
- User activity analytics
- Business metric dashboards

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- Container health checks
- Resource utilization tracking
- Network performance monitoring
- Security event monitoring

## Future Architecture Considerations

### Planned Enhancements
- Event sourcing for audit trails
- GraphQL API for improved frontend flexibility
- Machine learning for personalized recommendations
- Multi-tenant architecture for enterprise customers
- Real-time notifications with SignalR

### Scalability Roadmap
- Database sharding strategy
- Content delivery network expansion
- Edge computing for reduced latency
- Advanced caching layers
