# System Design Principles

## Overview
This document outlines the high-level system design principles for the MealPrep application, focusing on architectural patterns, design decisions, and quality attributes.

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
The system is organized around business domains to ensure clear separation of concerns and maintainability.

**Core Domains:**
- **User Management**: Authentication, user profiles, family management
- **Recipe Management**: Recipe CRUD, categorization, search, nutritional data
- **AI Suggestion Engine**: Gemini AI integration, persona-based recommendations
- **Menu Planning**: Weekly/monthly planning, scheduling, optimization
- **Shopping Lists**: Automated generation, ingredient consolidation, store integration

### 2. Microservices Architecture
Services are designed to be independently deployable and scalable.

**Service Boundaries:**
```
???????????????????    ???????????????????    ???????????????????
?   User Service  ?    ?  Recipe Service ?    ?    AI Service   ?
?                 ?    ?                 ?    ?                 ?
? - Authentication?    ? - CRUD          ?    ? - Gemini API    ?
? - Family Mgmt   ?    ? - Search        ?    ? - Personas      ?
? - Preferences   ?    ? - Categories    ?    ? - Suggestions   ?
???????????????????    ???????????????????    ???????????????????
         ?                       ?                       ?
         ?????????????????????????????????????????????????
                                 ?
                    ???????????????????
                    ?  Menu Service   ?
                    ?                 ?
                    ? - Planning      ?
                    ? - Scheduling    ?
                    ? - Shopping Lists?
                    ???????????????????
```

### 3. CQRS Pattern Implementation
Separate read and write operations for optimal performance and scalability.

**Command Side (Writes):**
- Recipe creation and updates
- Family member management
- Menu plan modifications
- User preference updates

**Query Side (Reads):**
- Recipe search and filtering
- Menu plan display
- AI suggestion retrieval
- Dashboard data aggregation

### 4. Event-Driven Architecture
Asynchronous communication between services using domain events.

**Key Events:**
- `RecipeCreated`
- `FamilyMemberAdded`
- `MenuPlanGenerated`
- `AIRequestCompleted`
- `UserPreferencesUpdated`

## Design Patterns

### 1. Repository Pattern
Abstraction layer for data access to ensure testability and flexibility.

```csharp
public interface IRecipeRepository
{
    Task<Recipe> GetByIdAsync(int id);
    Task<IEnumerable<Recipe>> GetByCuisineAsync(string cuisine);
    Task<Recipe> CreateAsync(Recipe recipe);
    Task UpdateAsync(Recipe recipe);
    Task DeleteAsync(int id);
}
```

### 2. Unit of Work Pattern
Manages transactions across multiple repositories.

```csharp
public interface IUnitOfWork : IDisposable
{
    IRecipeRepository Recipes { get; }
    IFamilyMemberRepository FamilyMembers { get; }
    IMenuPlanRepository MenuPlans { get; }
    Task<int> CommitAsync();
}
```

### 3. Factory Pattern
Creates complex objects and services, especially for AI providers.

```csharp
public interface IAiServiceFactory
{
    IAiService CreateGeminiService();
    IAiService CreateOpenAiService();
    IAiService CreateFallbackService();
}
```

### 4. Strategy Pattern
Interchangeable algorithms for different AI providers and recommendation strategies.

```csharp
public interface IMealSuggestionStrategy
{
    Task<IEnumerable<MealSuggestion>> GenerateSuggestionsAsync(
        FamilyProfile family, 
        MealConstraints constraints);
}
```

## System Boundaries
